    "### Introduction to Python and Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of Python Programming Language:\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It offers dynamic typing, automatic memory management, and a rich set of libraries and frameworks, making it suitable for various applications such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features of Python:**\n",
    "- Clear and readable syntax\n",
    "- Dynamically typed (no need to declare variables)\n",
    "- Automatic memory management (garbage collection)\n",
    "- Extensive standard library and third-party packages\n",
    "- Object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming paradigms\n",
    "- Cross-platform compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Data Types and Operations:\n",
    "Python supports several built-in data types and operations for handling different kinds of data efficiently. Some of the fundamental data types include:\n",
    "- **Integer (int):** Whole numbers without a fractional component.\n",
    "- **Float (float):** Real numbers with a decimal point.\n",
    "- **String (str):** Ordered collection of characters enclosed within single or double quotes.\n",
    "- **Boolean (bool):** Represents truth values, either True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Operations:**\n",
    "- Arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponentiation (**), modulus (%), floor division (//).\n",
    "- String operations: concatenation (+), repetition (*), slicing ([]), indexing.\n",
    "- Comparison operators: equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), etc.\n",
    "- Logical operators: and, or, not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Basic data types and operations\n",
    "num1 = 10\n",
    "num2 = 3.5\n",
    "string1 = \"Hello\"\n",
    "string2 = 'World'\n",
    "is_true = True\n",
    "\n",
    "# Arithmetic operations\n",
    "result = num1 + num2\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "\n",
    "# String operations\n",
    "concatenated_string = string1 + \" \" + string2\n",
    "print(\"Concatenated string:\", concatenated_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Comparison operators\n",
    "print(\"Is num1 greater than num2?\", num1 > num2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical operators\n",
    "print(\"Is num1 greater than 5 and num2 less than 4?\", num1 > 5 and num2 < 4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "Time complexity and space complexity are crucial factors in analyzing the efficiency of algorithms. They help us understand how the runtime and memory usage of an algorithm scale with input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** It measures the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It is typically expressed using Big O notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** It measures the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It is also expressed using Big O notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Time Complexities:**\n",
    "- O(1) - Constant time\n",
    "- O(log n) - Logarithmic time\n",
    "- O(n) - Linear time\n",
    "- O(n log n) - Linearithmic time\n",
    "- O(n^2) - Quadratic time\n",
    "- O(2^n) - Exponential time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def linear_search(arr, target):\n",
    "    for num in arr:\n",
    "        if num == target:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "    return False\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time complexity of linear search: O(n)\n",
    "# Space complexity of linear search: O(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will delve deeper into time and space complexity analysis to understand how different data structures and algorithms perform under various scenarios. We will learn techniques to optimize algorithms for better performance and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's embark on this journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms using Python!"
