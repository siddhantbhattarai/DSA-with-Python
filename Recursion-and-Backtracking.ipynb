    "Recursion and backtracking are powerful techniques used in computer science and programming to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursion:**\n",
    "   - Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.\n",
    "   - It involves breaking down a problem into smaller, similar subproblems until a base case is reached.\n",
    "   - Recursion consists of two parts: the base case(s), which provide a stopping condition for the recursion, and the recursive case(s), which call the function recursively to solve smaller instances of the problem.\n",
    "   - Recursion is often used to solve problems involving tree structures, such as tree traversal, as well as problems with repetitive substructures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backtracking:**\n",
    "   - Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding solutions to combinatorial problems.\n",
    "   - It is based on systematic exploration of all possible candidate solutions by recursively trying different choices.\n",
    "   - Backtracking involves making a series of choices, and if a choice turns out to be incorrect, the algorithm backs up and tries a different choice.\n",
    "   - It is often used to solve problems such as generating all permutations or combinations of a set, solving puzzles like Sudoku or the Eight Queens Problem, and finding paths in graph traversal problems.\n",
    "   - Backtracking typically involves recursion to explore different paths or choices, and it often employs pruning techniques to eliminate unpromising choices early in the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both recursion and backtracking are powerful techniques that can be used to solve a wide range of problems efficiently. However, they require careful design to ensure correctness and efficiency, especially for problems with large search spaces or complex recursive structures."
